        you don''t like, don''t like the way I walk\nAnd you don''t like, don''t like
        the way I talk\nYou criticize about me endlessly\nLogic defies how you get
        stuck with me\nAnd you complain about the clothes I wear\nAnd you explain
        there''s other boys out there\nYou complain my car makes too much noise\nAnd
        you cry I''m always out with the boys\n\nWhoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)\nI
        give up little darling (whoa whoa little darling)\nYeah no matter what I do,
        girl you know it''s true\nAin''t good enough for you\n\nYou complain the way
        I love you at night\nYou explain I''m really not your type\nIf we go out,
        you say I''m such a bore\nIf we stay in, you say what are we living for\nI
        don''t understand, there''s nothing I can do\nThere ain''t no way I can satisfy
        you\nEnd of the night I lean in for a kiss\nHere comes the pitch, a swing
        and a miss\n\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)\nI quit little darling
        (whoa whoa little darling)\nYeah no matter what I do, well you know it''s
        true\nAin''t good enough for you, hey!\nHey!\n(Come on boys!)\n\nWhoa whoa

        darling)\nNo matter what I do, girl you know it''s true\nAin''t good enough
        for you\n\nI tried to change, I got a job in sales\nI bought a shirt uptown
        in Bloomindales\nAnd babe I tried to make the latest scene\nHitting cool just
        like Jimmy Iovine\nI bought a record with all the latest grooves\nA book of
        love with all the latest moves\nI bought some flowers and I waited at your
        door\nAnd you came out, didn''t want to see me no more\n\nWhoa whoa whoa (whoa
        whoa whoa whoa)\nI quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling)\nYeah no
        matter what I do, girl you know it''s true\nAin''t good enough for you\nHey!
        Hey! Hey!\nNo matter what I do, girl you know it''s true\nAin''t good enough
        for you\nAww no matter what I do, girl you know it''s true\nAin''t good enough
        for you\nWhoaaa!"}]}'
